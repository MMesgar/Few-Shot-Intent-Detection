# Few-Shot-Intent-Detection


Few-Shot-Intent-Detection is a repository designed for few-shot intent detection with/without Out-of-Scope (OOS) intents. It includes popular challenging intent detection datasets and baselines.


**---Note: We will update the repository soon---**

## Intent detection datasets

We process data based on previous published resources, all the data are in the same format as [DNNC](https://github.com/jianguoz/DNNC-few-shot-intent).
